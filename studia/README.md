# Studia

This directory contains files with documentation required by my university to pass the subject.
**The documentation does not reflect the actual state of the project.**
I had not enough time (yet) to create CI/CD pipeline, or Helm charts,
or many other feature described in the documentation, so it's just a placeholder for now.
It for sure reflects what the project should look like in the future, but not now.

Files:

- [sow.md](sow.md) - Statement of Work
- [wdrozenie.md](wdrozenie.md) - Deployment process and verification steps
- [docs.md](docs.md) - Documentation
